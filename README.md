#GitC
* Are you lazy af?
* do you find yourself annoyed at typing ```git add -A``` and ```git commit -m "Stupid Commit"``` a ton?

##Then GitC is for you!!

##Installation
* Install the c++ script however you want -> (install.py simply gives the executable)
* Edit the c++ directly to change the default commit message and/or enable pushing to git on each run

##Future
I'd really like to:
* Make it so you can change the default commit msg just by sending in args (ie ```gitc -config msg=New Default Msg```
* Add more collaborators
